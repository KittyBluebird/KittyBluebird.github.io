# Buffy - The Narratology Slayer

Buffy Anne Summers was a normal All American Girl, a popular cheerleader.
Then she became The Chosen One, learning that she was the next avatar in a line of Slayers,
who are always young women destined to fight against evil and the forces of darkness, mainly Vampires.
That changed things for her. A lot.
